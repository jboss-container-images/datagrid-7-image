= Development guide

Prior to exploring this repository, it is highly advised to visit our https://docs.google.com/a/redhat.com/document/d/1gSGmytIW3u4IR1tXGmEekEa1AzhKfNvAPOAP0Fh32kQ/edit?usp=sharing[Contributing Guide].

This repository has the following structure:

```
+- Root
      +-- image.yaml - Image build recipe
      +-- Makefile - A set of useful scripts for development work
      +-- templates - OpenShift templates for this service
      +-- modules - Modules used for the image
      +-- functional-tests - Full end-to-end tests with Arquillian Cube
      +-- documentation - Resources for `this` Github page
      +-- capacity-tests - A set of capacity tests for calibrating memory settings
```

The `templates` directory contains a template for the Service Catalog. The easiest way to install it is to use `make install-templates-in-openshift-namespace`.

The `modules` directory contains modules used in `image.yaml`. See http://concreate.readthedocs.io/en/develop/[Concreate] documentation for more details.

The `functional-tests` directory contains http://arquillian.org/arquillian-cube/[Arquillian Cube tests]. The tests assume there is a running OpenShift cluster and `oc` or `kubectl` is already attached to it.

== Building the image
The `image.yaml` uses a Python framework called http://concreate.readthedocs.io/en/develop/[Concreate] to build an image. The easiest way to start the build is to invoke `concreate image.yaml target` and invoke a standard container build from the `target` directory.

Before using concreate, you should create a `.concreate` file in your home directory with the following content:
```
[common]
ssl_verify = False
cache_url = http://ce-cacher.usersys.redhat.com/get?#algorithm#=#hash#

[repositories]
jboss-os = http://git.app.eng.bos.redhat.com/git/jboss-container-tools.git/plain/repos/jboss-rhel-os.repo
jboss-ocp = http://git.app.eng.bos.redhat.com/git/jboss-container-tools.git/plain/repos/jboss-rhel-ocp.repo
jboss-rhscl = http://git.app.eng.bos.redhat.com/git/jboss-container-tools.git/plain/repos/jboss-rhel-rhscl.repo
jboss-rhom = http://git.app.eng.bos.redhat.com/git/jboss-container-tools.git/plain/repos/jboss-rhom.repo
```

== Testing
=== Local
In order to perform a full end-to-end test, invoke `make test-ci`. This will spin up a local OpenShift cluster, build the image, install the template, invoke end-to-end tests and kill the cluster.

=== Remote
In order to run the functional test suite against a remote OpenShift instance, follow these steps:

1. Login to the remote instance from command line using `oc`

   oc login <openshift address> --token=<token>

2. Set the environment variable with the address of the remote OpenShift container registry

   export OPENSHIFT_ONLINE_REGISTRY=<registry address>

3. Invoke `make test-remote`.
This procedure will create a new project in the remote OpenShift, build the image, push the image to the OpenShift internal registry, install the templates in the project and invoke functional tests.

4. Optional: When the image is already available in a remote Docker registry, invoke the following command to pull the image instead of building it. It is also necessary to specify the remote Docker registry and possibly different image coordinates:

   make DEV_IMAGE_ORG=datagrid-7-tech-preview DEV_IMAGE_NAME=datagrid-services DOCKER_REGISTRY_ENGINEERING=brew-pulp-docker01.web.prod.ext.phx2.redhat.com:8888 test-remote-with-pull
