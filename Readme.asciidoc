= Red Hat Data Grid Online Services

Red Hat Data Grid (RHDG) Online Services consists of a multiple services:

- Caching Service - In this service, Red Hat Data Grid is configured as an in-memory caching service without persistence. Data in the cache will be lost if the service is stopped or restarted, and therefore, it should not be used as a permanent store for data. It can be used to improve your application’s response time, by keeping frequently and recently accessed data in a high speed in-memory store.
- Shared Memory Service - In this image, Red Hat Data Grid is configured as a shared memory service with fault-tolerance. That means any data stored by the service will be preserved across restarts. Fault-tolerance is achieved by replicating data across multiple nodes. The data is copied to a specific number of nodes in the cluster using the `owners` setting. This ensures that, in the case of failure, the grid will not lose data as long as the number of failed nodes is less than the number of copies (owners). This also works when nodes are shutdown or restarted manually.

The services are based on https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/data-grid[Red Hat Data Grid] technology and they expose various endpoints and configurations depending on the use case.

== Detailed Cache Features

The detailed configuration is tightly connected to JDG Cache Configuration. The details might be found below:

Caching Service:
- No Cache Store
- Single, distributed (with number of owners set to 1) default cache
- Data eviction based on occupied memory
- Authentication

Shared Memory Service:
- No Cache Store
- Distributed caches (with specified number of owners) created on demand
- Caches destroyed after idle timeout
- No eviction
- Authentication

== Getting started

Before you begin working with JDG Online Services, you will need a working OpenShift cluster as well as an `oc` client in your `$PATH`. See  https://docs.openshift.com/online/welcome/index.html[OpenShift documentation] how to achieve this.

=== Installing JDG Online Services into Service Catalog

JDG Online Services are supported on OpenShift Container Platform 3.7 (and equivalents such as OpenShift Online). In order to
 make JDG Online Services available in the Service Catalog, the administrator needs to add all templates into `openshift`
 namespace. This can be done by invoking `oc create -f templates/caching-service.json -n openshift` and
 `oc create -f templates/shared-memory-service.json -n openshift` commands.


=== Instantiating JDG Online Service

Once the above templates are correctly installed, you can instantiate them using  the appropriate icon in the catalog.

Both Caching and Shared Memory services define a list of parameters, which have been explained below:

=== Creating a client application

Once you instantiate one of the services, you might want to connect to it using a Hot Rod or REST client.

Both endpoints use encryption as well as authentication. TLS certificates for the server are generated automatically
 by OpenShift. A client deployed inside OpenShift obtains them automatically (Kubernetes puts them in `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/service-ca.crt`). However when a client is deployed outside of the cloud,
 the easiest to obtain them is to use `oc` client. The last part is authentication - both user name and password
 are specified as the Caching Template parameters.

The https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-jdg-quickstarts/tree/jdg-7.2.x/caching-service[Caching Service quickstart] is
 the easiest way to get everything up and running. It shows how to deploy a client application into the cloud (using
 https://maven.fabric8.io/[Fabric8 Maven Plugin]) as well how to obtain a certificate from the `oc` client.

== Development guide

Prior to exploring this repository, it is highly advised to visit our https://docs.google.com/a/redhat.com/document/d/1gSGmytIW3u4IR1tXGmEekEa1AzhKfNvAPOAP0Fh32kQ/edit?usp=sharing[Contributing Guide].

This repository has the following structure:

```
+- Root
      +-- image.yaml - Image build recipe
      +-- Makefile - A set of useful scripts for development work
      +-- templates - OpenShift templates for this service
      +-- modules - Modules used for the image
      +-- functional-tests - Full end-to-end tests with Arquillian Cube
      +-- documentation - Resources for `this` Github page
      +-- capacity-tests - A set of capacity tests for calibrating memory settings
```

The `image.yaml` uses a Python framework called http://concreate.readthedocs.io/en/develop/[Concreate] to build an image. The easiest way to start the build is to invoke `concreate image.yaml target` and invoke a standard Docker build from the `target` directory.

The `Makefile` contains lots of small, useful scripts.

In order to perform a full end-to-end test, invoke `make test-ci`. This will spin up a local OpenShift cluster, build the image, install the template, invoke end-to-end tests and kill the cluster.

In order to run the functional test suite against a remote OpenShift instance, follow these steps:

1. Login to the remote instance from command line using `oc`

   oc login <openshift address> --token=<token>

2. Set the environment variable with the adddress of the remote OpenShift docker registry

   export OPENSHIFT_ONLINE_REGISTRY=<registry address>

3. Invoke `make test-remote`.
This procedure will create a new project in the remote OpenShift, build the image, push the image to the OpenShift internal registry, install the templates in the project and invoke functional tests.

The `templates` directory contains a template for the Service Catalog. The easiest way to install it is to use `make install-templates-in-openshift-namespace`.

The `modules` directory contains modules used in `image.yaml`. See http://concreate.readthedocs.io/en/develop/[Concreate] documentation for more details.

The `functional-tests` directory contains http://arquillian.org/arquillian-cube/[Arquillian Cube tests]. The tests assume there is a running OpenShift cluster and `oc` or `kubectl` is already attached to it.
